tc-vcs: {{version}}

This cli is designed to abstract the differences between hg/git and deal with
higher level concepts such as applying a set of changes from one repository unto
another and using various types of caches (s3 copies of entire clones) to speed
up downloads based on where your machine lives.

  --help : show this help message
  --config <path> : Override default configuration with a yaml file (see
                    Configuration)

Commands:

  clone : Determines the VCS in use and attempts to use caches prior to
          fetching.

Configuration (yaml file):

Example File:

# Override git
